          <p>
            This site is owned and operated by Rubens LP. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, www.rubenslp.com.br (this “Site”). Please read this privacy notice carefully as it contains
            important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use, and share personal information, your rights in relation to your personal information and on how to contact us and
            supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint.

            <br /><br />​ For the purposes of this privacy policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual.

            <br /><br />​ ​ Who We Are

            <br /><br />

            Rubens LP collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you.

            <br /><br />​ ​ Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

            <br /><br />​ ​ This website and any products and services offered herein are not intended for persons under the age of 13. Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection
            Act of 1998 (COPPA), The Site does not knowingly collect information from anyone under 13 years of age without parental consent. The Site prohibits children under the age of 13 from using
            all interactive portions of this website, including leaving any comments, filling out forms, or otherwise submitting information. The Site will not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13. If the Site learns it has any information or content from anyone under the age of 13, it will delete that information.

            <br /><br />​ ​ The Personal Information We Collect and Use ​<br /><br />​ Information Collected by Us <br /><br />​ The Site may gather two types of information about users: Information
            that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to sign up for emails or free gifts, register for a challenge, course, or webinar, leave
            comments, order a service or product, fill out any type of form, or otherwise contact the Site via an online form or email. Information The information collected may include your name,
            e-mail, address, phone number, and/or billing information. You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to merely access or visit this website. The Site may
            collect domain information, IP address and “cookies” (small files saved on your hard drive by your web browser) to analyze website and advertisement performance, track user patterns, save
            information from your previous visits and customize your experience. We will ask for your consent to allow us to use cookies. The Site or its third-party vendors may collect non-personal
            information through the use of these technologies. Non-personal information might include the browser you use, the type of computer you use and technical information about your means of
            connection to this website such as the operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. The Site’s systems may also automatically gather
            information about the date and time you access our Site, the pages you visit and search terms you use on this website and about the links you may select from within this website to other
            areas of the Internet. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message
            with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling, and surveys. If you
            are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and
            we are responsible as controller of that personal information for the purposes of those laws. <br /><br />​ Information Collected from Other Sources <br /><br />​ We also obtain your name
            and email from other sources, such as ConvertKit, Teachable. <br /><br />​ How we use your personal information <br /><br />​ The Site collects such information in order to communicate
            with you such as in emails, deliver services and products, complete customer transactions, oversee webinars, challenges and promotions and understanding and better managing our activities
            including analyzing data we hold about you to improve our website performance, products and customer service. <br /><br />​ Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold,
            exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service
            requested. <br /><br />​ Who We Share Your Personal Information With <br /><br />​ The Site respects your privacy and will never sell, trade or transfer your personally identifiable
            information to third parties (beyond what is necessary for fulfilling a customer transaction or for the basic functionality of an online service) without your consent. We do, however,
            disclose your personal information to our third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (such as our web hosting provider, credit card processors and shipping
            companies). Where we use service providers who might have access to your personal information, we require them to have privacy and security standards that are comparable to ours. We use
            contracts and other measures with our service providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of your personal information and to prevent it from being used for any other purpose.
            Some of our service providers who we disclose your personal information to as contemplated in, and in accordance with, this privacy policy may be located in jurisdictions outside the
            United States. As a result, your personal information may be used, stored and/or accessed in countries outside of the United States. However, all such personal information will be
            protected in accordance with this privacy policy. Please note that when your personal information is located outside of the United States it will be subject to the laws of the country in
            which it is situated and these jurisdictions may not have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your country. The third-party recipients are based outside the European
            Economic Area — for further information including on how we safeguard your personal data when this occurs, see Transfer of your information out of the EEA. <br /><br />​ The Site may
            release personal information to enforce its Website Terms and Conditions of Use, other Terms and Conditions, manage its business, protect users or the general public, or to otherwise
            comply with legal obligations. <br /><br />​ If you give the Site your permission, it may also use personal identification information for internal or external marketing and promotional
            purposes. <br /><br />​ On occasion, the Site may collect personal identification information from you in connection with optional contests, special offers or promotions. The Site will
            share such information with necessary third parties for the purpose of carrying out the contest, special offer or promotion. We will ask for your consent to such disclosure and use of such
            information, prior to your participation in the contest, special offer or promotion.

            <br /><br />​ We will not share your personal information with any other third party. <br /><br />​ Whether Information Has to Be Provided by You and Why <br /><br />​ The provision of
            name, email, phone, and address is required from you to enable us to send your free downloads and/or purchase products or services from the site. We do not require you to provide any
            personal data in order to simply visit the site. We will inform you when we collect it whether you are required to provide the information to us. <br /><br />​ How Long Your Personal
            Information Will Be Kept <br /><br />​ We will only retain your personal information (e.g. name, address and contact details) as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes
            for which it was collected or as required by law. Your personal information is securely stored until such time as it is no longer required, after which it is destroyed, rendering it unable
            to identify you. <br /><br />​ Reasons We Can Collect and Use Your Personal Information <br /><br />​ The Site collects and uses your personal information for the following lawful bases:
            communicate with you such as in emails, deliver services and products, complete customer transactions, oversee webinars, challenges and promotions and understanding and better managing our
            activities including analyzing data we hold about you to improve our website performance, products, and customer service. <br /><br />​ Your information, whether public or private, will
            not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product
            or service requested. <br /><br />​ Third-Party Analytics <br /><br />​ We use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to evaluate your use of the Websites, compile
            reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Websites and mobile and Internet usage. These third

            subject to a duty of confidentiality. <br /><br />​ We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable authorities of a

            policies. The Site is not responsible for or liable for any content on or actions taken by such third-party websites. <br /><br />​ Accessing Your Information and Addressing Privacy
